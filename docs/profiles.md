Commands can be overridden through the caller contract. Catalog-listed waivable stages need an explicit non-applicability reason; selected tests and security remain required. Optional owned cleanup runs when declared.

## Native defaults

Native command arrays, manifests and report contracts live in the
[runtime catalog](../src/nddev_cicd/profiles.json). The caller overrides only applicable
stages through its native project contract; required stages remain required.
